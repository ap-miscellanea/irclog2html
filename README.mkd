This script converts IRC logs in UTF-8 to HTML pages, while
attempting to stay as close to no parsing as feasible.

The generated web page contains an anchor for each line so
that you can jump to and link to specific lines, and cut-off
links to select a particular portion of the log. Links in
conversation will also be clickable.

It requires [Object::Tiny][1], [Digest::SHA1][2],
[Hash::MultiValue][3], and Perl 5.10 (or newer).

### Usage

	irclog2html \#foo.1.log \#foo.2.log > channel-foo.log.html

### CGI mode

If the script detects that it was run in a CGI environment, it
will look at the `PATH_TRANSLATED` environment variable for
the filename to read. The assumption is that the script will
be run by the web server to handle requests against particular
files.

Put it somewhere for your web server to find, eg.:

	ln -s `which irclog2html` /var/www/cgi-bin/irclog2html.cgi

Then add something like the following lines to `.htaccess` or
to your Apache configuration:

	AddCharset utf-8         .irclog
	AddType    text/x-irclog .irclog
	Action     text/x-irclog /cgi-bin/irclog2html.cgi

After that, any file with the extension `.irclog` in your web
serverâ€™s document root will automatically be rendered as an
IRC log.
